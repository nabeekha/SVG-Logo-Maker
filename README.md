# SVG-Logo-Maker
Application that uses Node.js to create a logo to save as an SVG file

## Description

This application enables a user to create a pictographic logo by entering in answers to a few questions. The applciation utilizes various technologies for back-end registration. The application leverages JavaScript and Node.js in order to create various commands. Tests are run utilizing the Jest package and questions are brought up using the Inquirer package. By doing this, I strengthened my knowledge of Node.js technology and how backend infrastructure is created. Additionally, this leverages Object-Oriented Programming principles that will serve as the groundwork for coding in the future.
